I am a research scientist in [CVLab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland,
working with Prof. [Pascal Fua](http://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](http://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann). The research areas that I involved and
interested include optical flow, motion analysis, and object pose
estimation. In 2017, I completed my Ph.D. degree from Xidian
University under the supervision of Prof. [Yunsong Li](http://ipic.xidian.edu.cn). Before that, I have been working as a senior algorithm engineer and
technical leader for nearly 4 years in Zienon, LLC.
