I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch) of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/),
collaborated with [Pascal Fua](http://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua) and [Mathieu Salzmann](http://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann). The research areas that I involved and
interested include optical flow, motion analysis, and object pose
estimation. In 2017, I completed my Ph.D. degree from Xidian
University, China. Before that, I worked as a senior algorithm engineer and
technical leader in Zienon, LLC.
